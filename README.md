Loikki's Tools for DnD
======================

This repository aims to give a character generator (and a few DM tools) for DnD 5e.
Only the interface will be on github (not the data containing all the DnD informations) and the user should build his own.
I am trying to avoid any violation of the license and will be glad to make any change if requested.

If I have enough time, some example xml files will be given with the open datas of DnD.

The following images are taken from my code. Due to PyQt, the visual part of the program is adapted on each OS (here is Linux).

First the loader.

Now the Character's Generator

And finally, the Character Play
